# Gangster's GangLife

Here is some more information about becoming an official gang in our city!<br>
There are 3 headings with information.<br>
Make sure that you always start unofficially, you work your way up in the underworld through different ways.<br>
We pay attention to seriousness, roleplay scenarios and overall behavior of all members in a gang.<br>
If abuse is committed by certain members in your gang, options can be taken away by the staff.<br>
This can ultimately result in a gang wipe (your gang is no longer official).<br>
